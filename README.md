# Duplicati Enterprise Backup Server
=========================================

**Duplicati Enterprise Backup Server** is a monitoring dashboard for the excellent [Duplicati](https://github.com/duplicati/duplicati) project.

Based on [node.js](http://nodejs.org), it aims to make a real-time dashboard for a large installation of backup clients.  The core of the project is forked from the [Hackathon Starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter) project.

This project was sponsored by [Computer Connections of WI, Inc.](http://ccwis.com) and developed by [Ryan Hoshor](http://farmsoftstudios.com).
